// globalThis.prisma: This global variable ensures that the Prisma client instance is
// reused across hot reloads during development. Without this, each time your application
// reloads, a new instance of the Prisma client would be created, potentially leading
// to connection issues.
// globalThis.prisma is used to store the Prisma client instance globally, which helps
// in reusing the same instance across different parts of the application.
